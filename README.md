# PLL1 PCB Project
This project showcases the design and implementation of a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL1) circuit using KiCad8.0. It includes schematic design, PCB layout, and fabrication files. After generating the Gerber files, the board was fabricated and manually assembled. Prior to fabrication, functionality was verified using a perfboard prototype.
